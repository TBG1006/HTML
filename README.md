# Background:

The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, I first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

After assembling the dataset, I used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the souce data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnesseed.
